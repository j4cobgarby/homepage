            Hi, welcome to my website! I'm a third-year computer science student
            at the University of Nottingham, where I'm also on the committee of 
            <a href="https://hacksocnotts.co.uk/">HackSoc</a>, where I run some
            talks and workshops.
        </p>
        <p class="about">
            My main interests within computer science are processor architecture,
            operating systems, embedded systems, and computer graphics. Outside
            of computer science I have many other interests, including designing
            circuits, CNC machining, playing guitar and double bass, and drinking
            tea.
        </p>
        <p class="about">
            In the following blog, I'll talk about whatever projects I'm currently
            working on. Enjoy!
        </p>

    Hello everyone, welcome to my blog! This post is mainly to test the system I've
    made for automatically compiling blog posts and packing them into the webpage.
</p>
<p>
    I'm using jinja2 along with a little Python script to read all the files in a posts directory,
    and copy them into div tags in the html file that you're reading. The post titles and dates are
    automatically written based on the name of the post file and the date the file was created.
</p>
<p>
    (And yes, I could've used a pre-existing blogging framework, but this was fun:)
