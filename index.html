        <p class="about">
            Hi, welcome to my website. I'm a third-year computer science student
            at the University of Nottingham, where I'm also on the committee of 
            <a href="https://hacksocnotts.co.uk/">HackSoc</a>, where I run some
            talks and workshops.
        </p>
        <p class="about">
            My main interests within computer science are processor architecture,
            operating systems, embedded systems, and computer graphics. Outside
            of computer science I have many other interests, including designing
            circuits, CNC machining, playing guitar and double bass, and drinking
            tea.
        </p>
        <p class="about">
            In the following blog, I'll talk about whatever projects I'm currently
            working on. Enjoy!
