    Hello everyone, welcome to my blog! This post is mainly to test the system I've
    made for automatically compiling blog posts and packing them into the webpage.
</p>
<p>
    I'm using jinja2 along with a little Python script to read all the files in a posts directory,
    and copy them into div tags in the html file that you're reading. The post titles and dates are
    automatically written based on the name of the post file and the date the file was created.
</p>

    (And yes, I could've used a pre-existing blogging framework, but this was fun:)
